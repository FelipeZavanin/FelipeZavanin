Since childhood, the world of games has always fascinated me, sparking my desire to create engaging and innovative experiences. I dedicate hours to studying programming and design, exploring different tools and languages that help me turn ideas into reality. I believe that each game has the power to tell a unique story and connect people from all over the world. I am determined to improve myself and contribute to this incredible industry, creating worlds that inspire and entertain.
